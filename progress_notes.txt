currently rerunning mesma with looser RMSE constraints on Landsat 5 imagery? 
also trying to rerun phenology generator with annual data instead of biennial 
fix linear interpolation for phenoseries? probably not actually a good way to do this...

document clear linear relationship between GV and NDVI - less incentive to actually run MESMA in landscapes like this? at least if using Landsat timeseries 

realized too late that there's seemingly something wrong with many of my MESMA unmixing results for data/stacked_scenes (VAFB Landsat 5) 
- this means the GV pheno curves are unusable for the VAFB meeting this week >.<

gv_change <- f(gv_before, spei, flow, year?)
gv <- f(gv_before, month, month^2, spei, flow)
consider flow not as accumulated flow, but number of months (or how late in year) flow persists
